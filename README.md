### Gameplay Explanation

The idea of the game is to find your way to the exit. There are different ways that you can do this but you can tailor your experience in your own way. Different items in the game give you different properties. 

##### Items

The SpeedBoost increases your speed by 0.1 each time you pick one up.
The PickPocket item increases your pickup radius by 0.1 each time you pick up that item, giving you the ability to reach items further than you could before.
The HealthBoost item gives you a heart back upon picking it up, however, they are wasted if picked up at full health.
The Multiplier item adds 0.01 to your overall multiplier bonus upon picking up, making your other items more effective the next time you pick one up.

##### Enemies

The Spiders are your enemies, they will deal 1 damage to you every 4 seconds. They cannot be attacked, so you must avoid them at all costs.
