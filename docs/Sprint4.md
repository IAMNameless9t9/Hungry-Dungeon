  ## Demo
  
  This sprint, we completed:
  
  * We implemented a fixed camera
  * We made a visual inventory
  * We added a game-over and win screen
  * Player now has health and can die
  * Added a level exit, so the player can "win"
  * Ghosts can be killed by Lazer
  * Implemented Unity Testing
  * Fixed Enemy and Item spawning algorithm
  
  Here are screenshots of what we did:
 

  
  ## Retro
  
  ### Good
  
  * We have a working game, not a polished one, but a playable one.
  * We are running into a lot less issues with the project.

  ### Bad
  
  * Testing framework on Unity is a pain.
  * Keeping the project progress up-to-date was a struggle.
  
  ### Actionable Commitments
  
  * We are going to work together as a group each day to push to the finish line.
