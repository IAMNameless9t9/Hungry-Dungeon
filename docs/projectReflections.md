 ## Project Reflections
 
 ### Nathanael L. Mann
 
 This was an exciting project, despite the ups and downs of working with a team that wasn’t always there. We learned not only how to use Unity and gained more experience with Git and GitHub, but also how to work better with a team. There were some parts that were slow, and we didn’t end up getting everything done that we originally planned, but in the end, I think we made a decent product of a game, given that none of us had any previous experience with Unity and Agile.

This project was a great insight into Game Development and has given me a new perspective on my favorite games and how they are made, what time and effort go into them, and just the experience of creating something with code. Making this game has given me a great deal of experience when it comes to game development and I have learned so much along the way. 

 ### Mark Bridgewater

This project was a good look into how development on a team using agile development. The use of scrum brought a lot of challenges to overcome and figure out and in the end will make a huge impact on how I will work on a team in the future. This project also brought a lot of knowledge of how Game Development on Unity works.

 ### Jacob Coomes
 
This project was interesting because it was my first time not only making a game, but also doing it with a team. There were different types of challenges that we tried to figure out and got to experience different types of ways to implement different game mechanics in code. Figuring out how to communicate with teammates during this pandemic and all of us having bad internet connections in our own homes. Though we did get to make a game, it was a hassle to try and update it with our code when someone changed it already and it doesn’t match our files on our computers. I feel like this was how game developers are making games right now during this pandemic in their own homes right now.
