  ## Retro
  
  ### Good
  
  * People learned and adapted quickly to new technologies.
  * We accomplished more than our minimum goal.
  
  ### Bad
  
  * Mettings need to be better planned, so people can eaisily get ahold of one another.
  * Getting Unity and GitHub to work togther was a struggle.
  
  ### Actionable Commitments
  
  * As a team, we will attend scheduled meetings twice a week, in order to keep in touch.
  * Individually, we will watch/research/learn how to better use Unity, GitHub, and any other resources necessary for this project.
