Each level will have a unique design that requires different strategies to surpass.

  * Powerups can be bought at a shop or found in the level
  * 4 Enemy types (based on the Ghosts in original Pacman)
  * Various Subtypes of enemies
  * Minibosses that must be defeated to get to the next floor
  * Unlocakble skins as rewards for progressing through the game
  * Final Boss Battle
