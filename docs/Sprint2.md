  ## Demo
  
  This sprint, we completed:
  
  * We implemented C# scripts to allow for grid-snapped player movement.
  * We resolved several issues revolving around Unity and GitHub file sharing.
  * We setup an architectureal document, detailing the aspects of the game.
  * We designed a heirarchy for the games 'moving object parts'
  * We implemented a basic Enemy AI template that can be expanded.
  * We implemented an empty template for items/powerups.

  ## Retro
  
  ### Good
  
  * We got together far more often and were able to help each other/work as a team.
  * Found new ways of working together and participating in the code writing process.
  * Meetings were far more frequent/reliable.

  ### Bad
  
  * We need to allocate our time better so we aren't cramming at the end.
  * We need to be on the same page more when it comes to the code.
  
  ### Actionable Commitments
  
  * As a group, we will plan out our work days better, so that things get done throughout the sprint.
  
  ## Planning
  
  Points | Story
  -------|--------
  3      | We need to make a designpatterns.md document. 
  5      | As a player, I want to see the items in my inventory and what powerup I have equipped.
  8      | As a player, I want procedurally generated levels so each run is unique.
  3      | As a player, I want a level-design that is easy to follow/use.
  8      | As a developer, I want to polish the existing code so that it functions as intended.
