  ## Retro
  
  ### Good
  
  * We finished everything that we set out to do.
  * We polished up a lot of the "sloppy" code from previous sprints.

  ### Bad
  
  * Mark's life sucked during this sprint, but he got through it.
  
  ### Actionable Commitments
  
  * As a group, we will get things done earlier in the sprint rather than later.
